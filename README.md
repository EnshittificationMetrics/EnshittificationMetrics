# EnshittificationMetrics

**Enshittification Metrics <https://enshittificationmetrics.com/index> is a site that gathers and displays enshittification metrics for (popular) tech platforms.**

Code is covered by Business Source License (BUSL) v1.1. Included in this code is: mod-wsgi (Web Server Gateway Interface (Python to HTML)); Flask (web framework); Python; Jinja; HTML; CSS; SQLite; flask_migrate; flask_login; SQL Alchemy; Beautiful Soup; html5lib; LangChain; cloud LLM by API; flask_simple_captcha; werkzeug.security; pyotp; pyotp; flask_wtf; wtforms; more. Pretty much all code is built using FOSS libraries, which you can of course directly use too. However the code that makes the Enshittification Metrics site is basically proprietary (Enshittification Metrics' intellectual property (IP)); you can view it, see how it works, check out algorithms, even copy it for non-production non-commercial uses. It may be possible to license this code, or hire our developers to write some similar code for you, reach out to "bristol numeral four at enshittification metrics (one word) dot com" as appropriate.

Transparency and fairness in judgment and assignment of metric scores is a goal of this site; as such all judgment processes algorithms and LLM use are exposed - visit https://github.com/EnshittificationMetrics/EnshittificationMetrics to **see all code in use**. This site strives to be fully automated, enabling all news gathering and metrics value determinations to occur automatically by way of software code and generative-AI agentic functions. Our Ethics Board serves as critical human-in-the-loop; ensuring the autonomous metric gathering and reporting is reasonable and human-friendly.
