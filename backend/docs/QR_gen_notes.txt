--level={L|M|Q|H}
-l {L|M|Q|H}
Use L (Low) (7% data restore) when you need the QR code to store more data and it's unlikely to be damaged.
Use M (Medium) (15% data restore) for general use where minimal damage may occur.
Use Q (Quartile) (25% data restore) for cases where you expect moderate wear, like flyers or brochures.
Use H (High) (30% data restore) if the QR code will be subjected to potential damage, like outdoor environments or where the code may get scratched or partially obscured.

--size=NUMBER
-s NUMBER
controls the pixel size of each module in the QR code
Larger module sizes (--size values) produce bigger QR codes, which can be easier to scan from a distance or when printed on large surfaces (e.g., posters).
Smaller module sizes make more compact QR codes, which are ideal for smaller prints (e.g., business cards), but may be harder to scan if reduced too much.
Default size = 3
